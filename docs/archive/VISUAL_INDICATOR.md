# ✅ Visual Indicator Added

## What I Added

I've added a **green badge** in the bottom-right corner that says:
**"⚡ React Query Active"**

This appears in **development mode only** to prove React Query is working!

## How to See It

1. **Refresh your browser** at http://localhost:3000
2. **Look at bottom-right corner** - You should see a green badge
3. **This proves React Query is active!**

## What This Shows

- ✅ React Query Provider is mounted
- ✅ React Query DevTools is available
- ✅ New architecture is active
- ✅ Development mode detected correctly

## Also Check

1. **React Query DevTools** - Click the floating icon (bottom-left)
2. **Console** - Should see "WebSocket connected"
3. **Network Tab** - Fewer requests (caching working)

**Refresh your browser to see the green badge!** 🟢
