## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you see search results:
- ✅ You're searching instead of navigating
- **Fix:** Type `http://localhost:3000` directly in the address bar

### If you see "This site can't be reached":
- ✅ Frontend server might not be running
- **Fix:** Run `.\start-development.ps1` to start servers

### If you see "Connection refused":
- ✅ Backend might not be running
- **Fix:** Check that backend is running on port 8000

### If page is blank:
- ✅ Wait 10-15 seconds for servers to fully start
- **Fix:** Refresh the page (F5)
